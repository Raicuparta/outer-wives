# Outer Wives

An Outer Wilds dating sim. Sorry.

Pick (almost) any character to be your wife. Talk to your favorite character to get started.

## Difficulty

I'm not about to test this with every single character, but some of them might be pretty difficult to pull off without cheats. If you find it too difficult, try using the [Slow Time](https://outerwildsmods.com/mods/slowtime/) mod to give you more time.

## Compatibility with other mods

I don't guarantee it will work with all mods, but if another mod adds characters to the main Solar System scene, you should be able to marry the characters added by that mod. For instance, if you install [New Horizons Examples](https://outerwildsmods.com/mods/newhorizonsexamples/), you can marry Ernesto.
